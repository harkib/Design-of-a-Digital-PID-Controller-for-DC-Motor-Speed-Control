# Design-of-a-Digital-PID-Controller-for-DC-Motor-Speed-Control
In this project, the aim is design and simulation of a DC motor closed-loop control system to meet the following criteria for a 1 rad/sec step reference:  Settling time less than 2 seconds  Overshoot less than 5%  Steady-state error less than 1%
